Module 4: Lab 4


Inheritance
Write a base class called Vehicle that includes the following:
* wheels: int
* speed: int
* cylinders: int


Write the following three derived classes:
Bicycle
* weight: int
Car
* seats: int
Boat
* length: int


Write a program that demonstrates that all of your classes are working properly.

Function and Operator Overloading
Write a class called Shapes that includes overloaded functions for the following shapes:
* Square
* Triangle
* Circle
For each Shape, include the following functions:
* area
* circumference
* vertices
* print
* update
For each function, determine what parameters of what types it needs to accept and what it needs to return.
Hint: area and circumference parameters and return value should NOT be int.
Of course, also determine what attributes you need to define in the class.


For each Shape, include the following operators:
* +
* *
* =
Each of these operators should take in the same class type(s) and return (also) the same type as indicated by the operator.


For example, for + with a triangle, add each of the attributes in order to return the new triangle.

UML
Using a UML class diagram, design a program to store information about a course at your school. 
Your program should contain the following classes:


  



A course will have a maximum of 30 students and only one professor. 
Determine what other information and functionality each class should include. Make sure that each class includes at least 3 attributes and 2 functions (or operators).
Once the class diagram has been completed, write the classes and the program that tests the functionality of the classes.
